# 1st-Cryptography_Project
 In this first programming project, you and your team will implement a program in which you compare the efficiency of the algorithms shown below. Remember that, on this occasion, you do not need to implement the algorithms, you only use the implementations that the programming language you choose has. This implies the selection of a library that already implements the given algorithms. To do this, you need to generate a set of testing vectors that follow the input of each algorithm. These will allow you to measure the time your computer takes executing each algorithm.
